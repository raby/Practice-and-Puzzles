About Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm:
In computer science, the Bronâ€“Kerbosch algorithm is an algorithm for finding maximal cliques in an undirected graph. That is, it lists all subsets of vertices with the two properties that each pair of vertices in one of the listed subsets is connected by an edge, and no listed subset can have any additional vertices added to it while preserving its complete connectivity. 

Test case 2 is example graph on wikipedia page.
